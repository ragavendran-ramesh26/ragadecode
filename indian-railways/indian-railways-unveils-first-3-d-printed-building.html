                            <p>Indian Railways has made history by completing its first 3D-printed building—a “Gangman Hut”—at Parvatipuram Railway Station in Andhra Pradesh. Built in just 25 days, this groundbreaking achievement signals a major leap toward faster, cost-effective, and eco-friendly infrastructure development.</p>
<h2>What Is the Gangman Hut?</h2>
<p>A Gangman Hut is a resting shelter for railway track maintenance staff, known as &quot;gangmen.&quot; These structures are critical in providing workers a space to take breaks and store equipment while working on the tracks. The 3D-printed Gangman Hut at Parvatipuram is the first of its kind in the Indian Railways ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Built in Record Time with 3D Concrete Printing</h2>
<p>The construction was carried out by <strong>Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL)</strong>, a public sector undertaking under the Ministry of Railways. Using <strong>3D concrete printing technology</strong>, the hut was built in <strong>just 25 days</strong>—a fraction of the time traditional construction would take.</p>
<p>The structure spans approximately <strong>100 square meters</strong> (1,076 square feet) and was printed using <strong>Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC)</strong> and lightweight concrete. The technology allows for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster construction with minimal human labor</li>
<li>Reduced material waste</li>
<li>Greater design flexibility</li>
<li>Lower environmental impact</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Step Toward Sustainable Infrastructure</h2>
<p>This project aligns with India’s broader push toward green development and technological innovation. It supports major government missions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PM Gati Shakti</strong>: A national master plan for multi-modal connectivity</li>
<li><strong>Green India Mission</strong>: Promoting sustainable and eco-friendly initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p>By adopting 3D printing technology, Indian Railways is not only speeding up its infrastructure projects but also significantly reducing carbon footprints and operational costs.</p>
<h2>Future of 3D Printing in Railways</h2>
<p>This successful implementation opens the door to more 3D-printed structures across the country. From office spaces and control rooms to restrooms and other utility buildings, Indian Railways is set to transform how it builds and maintains infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The 3D-printed Gangman Hut at Parvatipuram is more than just a structure—it’s a symbol of Indian Railways’ commitment to innovation, sustainability, and efficiency. With this milestone, Indian Railways sets a new benchmark for infrastructure development, one that could revolutionize the future of construction in the public sector.</p>
