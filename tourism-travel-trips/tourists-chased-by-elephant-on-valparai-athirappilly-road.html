                            <p>The Valparai–Athirappilly forest road is a scenic route known for its breathtaking views, thick greenery, and winding paths. While it’s a favorite among tourists and bikers, forest officials have consistently warned travelers—especially those on two-wheelers—against using this path. The area is a known wildlife corridor, often frequented by elephants.</p>
<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>On June 21, a group of tourists on a two-wheeler set out from Valparai toward Athirappilly. As they traveled through the dense forest road, they encountered an unexpected and terrifying sight—an elephant standing directly ahead of them on the road.</p>
<p>Unaware of the danger at first, the tourists slowed down and hesitated. But within seconds, the elephant began to charge directly toward them. The video—captured either by the tourists themselves or someone from another vehicle—shows the moment panic strikes. The riders frantically try to U-turn their vehicle, struggling in the narrow, curved road. Shouts and engine roars fill the air as the elephant picks up speed.</p>
<p>The bikers narrowly manage to escape, but the elephant chases them down the road for a few meters before slowing and turning back. The entire episode is heart-pounding and highlights just how quickly things can turn dangerous in wildlife zones.</p>
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p><a href="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/Tourists_Chased_by_Elephant_on_Valparai_Athirappilly_Road_ec6721d3cb.mp4">Tourists Chased by Elephant on Valparai–Athirappilly Road</a></p>
<p>This video has gone viral on social media and serves as a powerful reminder of why forest rules exist. The Forest Department has since reiterated its advisory: avoid using two-wheelers on this route. Motorbikes are slower to reverse or turn on narrow paths, and offer little protection in the event of a wildlife encounter.</p>
<p>The Athirappilly–Valparai road is surrounded by dense forest, home to numerous wild species including elephants. Their movement in this area is natural and frequent. Human interference, especially unprepared or risky travel, not only puts lives in danger but also disturbs the natural rhythm of the forest.</p>
<h2>Final Word</h2>
<p>Following forest department guidelines is crucial—for both human safety and wildlife conservation. Let’s respect nature’s boundaries and ensure that our quest for adventure doesn’t come at the cost of our lives or the peace of the wild.</p>
