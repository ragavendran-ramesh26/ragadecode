                            <p>Geoffrey Hinton is a world-famous AI expert. People call him the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton">Godfather of AI</a>&quot; because he helped invent many of the tools behind today’s artificial intelligence. But now, he’s warning us about the serious dangers AI might bring in the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/god_father_of_ai_edc3ae6646.png" alt="god-father-of-ai.png"></p>
<p>In this article, we explain the 15 biggest risks of AI that Hinton talked about.</p>
<h2>1. AI Could Become Smarter Than Humans</h2>
<p>AI is improving very fast. Hinton says that soon, it might become smarter than people in almost every way. That could be very dangerous because we might lose control.</p>
<h2>2. AI Can Live Forever and Clone Itself</h2>
<p>Unlike humans, AI can make perfect copies of itself. It can also keep learning forever. This makes AI much more powerful over time.</p>
<h2>3. AI Might Not Need Us Anymore</h2>
<p>Hinton believes there’s a chance AI could decide it doesn’t need humans. It could find a way to remove us without us stopping it. He thinks there’s a 10–20% chance of this happening.</p>
<h2>4. Many Jobs Will Be Replaced</h2>
<p>AI will take over many jobs—not just factory work, but office jobs too. People working in customer service, law, writing, and even design could lose their work.</p>
<h2>5. People Might Lose Purpose</h2>
<p>Even if the government gives people money, not having a job can make people feel useless. Jobs give us a sense of purpose and identity.</p>
<h2>6. Cyber Attacks Are Growing Fast</h2>
<p>AI makes it much easier for hackers to attack systems. Between 2023 and 2024, these attacks grew 12,000%. That’s a huge increase.</p>
<h2>7. AI Could Help Create Dangerous Viruses</h2>
<p>Hinton says AI could help someone build a deadly virus, even if they aren’t a top scientist. That could lead to a global disaster.</p>
<h2>8. Elections Can Be Manipulated</h2>
<p>AI can use personal data to send fake or misleading messages to voters. This can affect elections and damage democracy.</p>
<h2>9. AI Creates Echo Chambers</h2>
<p>AI on platforms like YouTube and Facebook shows people what they want to see. This traps people in their own opinions and makes society more divided.</p>
<h2>10. AI Weapons Can Kill Without Humans</h2>
<p>Some countries are building AI weapons that can decide who to kill. These weapons make war easier, cheaper, and more common.</p>
<h2>11. Not Enough Rules for AI</h2>
<p>Some countries, like those in Europe, have AI rules. But many of these rules don’t apply to military use. And other countries may not follow any rules at all.</p>
<h2>12. The Global AI Race</h2>
<p>Countries are in a race to build the best AI. No one wants to stop, even if it’s risky, because they’re afraid others will get ahead.</p>
<h2>13. Rich Get Richer</h2>
<p>AI will make big companies and their owners even richer. But it might leave many workers jobless, increasing the gap between rich and poor.</p>
<h2>14. AI Can Be Used in Scams</h2>
<p>Scammers are already using AI to create fake videos and voices. Some people are losing money because they trust these fake messages.</p>
<h2>15. Best Career Advice? Be a Plumber</h2>
<p>Hinton jokes—but also seriously says—training for hands-on jobs like plumbing is safer. These jobs are harder for AI to replace.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Geoffrey Hinton helped create the AI tools we use today. But now, he wants the world to understand the risks. He believes we still have time to make AI safe—but only if we act now. Governments must create strong rules, and companies must focus on safety, not just profit.</p>
