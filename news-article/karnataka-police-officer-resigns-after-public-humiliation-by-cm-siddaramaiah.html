                            <p>The resignation of Additional Superintendent of Police N. V. Baramani in Karnataka has ignited a fierce debate on the dignity of public servants. His decision to step down followed an alleged public humiliation by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah during a political rally. The incident, which took place on April 28, 2025, has led to political controversy, media coverage, and questions about the relationship between elected officials and bureaucrats.</p>
<h2>The Incident: A Moment of Public Humiliation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date and Location</strong>: April 28, 2025, during a Congress rally in Belagavi.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: BJP women workers protested with black flags during the rally.</li>
<li><strong>Chief Minister&#39;s Reaction</strong>: CM Siddaramaiah, visibly angry over the security lapse, called ASP Baramani to the stage.</li>
<li><strong>Controversial Gesture</strong>: Siddaramaiah raised his hand as if to slap Baramani, an act that was caught on camera and widely shared online.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Officer’s Response: Resignation Letter Speaks Volumes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emotional Toll</strong>: Baramani said the incident shattered his morale and left his family in emotional distress.</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary Retirement Request</strong>: He submitted his resignation on June 14, 2025.</li>
<li><strong>Quote from Letter</strong>: “Even though I avoided being slapped, I could not escape humiliation. How can I uphold justice when I’m denied dignity?”</li>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>: Baramani is a seasoned officer with over 31 years of service.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Government Reaction: Attempts to Retain Him</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ministers Involved</strong>: Both CM Siddaramaiah and Home Minister G. Parameshwara appealed to Baramani to reconsider.</li>
<li><strong>Status of Resignation</strong>: As of early July 2025, the Karnataka government has not officially accepted the resignation.</li>
<li><strong>Internal Deliberations</strong>: Sources suggest the administration is trying to persuade him to withdraw the request.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Larger Conversation: Respect for Public Servants</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Outrage</strong>: The video sparked debate about the treatment of civil servants.</li>
<li><strong>Support for Baramani</strong>: Many retired and current officers backed his stance, seeing it as a stand for professional dignity.</li>
<li><strong>Unanswered Questions</strong>: The incident raises deeper questions—Can public servants perform their duties fearlessly if publicly undermined?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Latest Update: Baramani May Have Resumed Duties</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post-Resignation Talks</strong>: New reports suggest that Baramani may have resumed duties after another round of talks with senior leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Awaiting Confirmation</strong>: As of July 3, 2025, there is no official confirmation regarding his return.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>ASP N. V. Baramani’s resignation saga has turned into a case study of institutional dignity versus political overreach. His situation has highlighted the fragile balance between authority and respect in governance. Whether he resumes duty or retires, the incident has already left a lasting impression on Karnataka’s administrative and political circles.</p>
