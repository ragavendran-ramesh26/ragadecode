                            <p><strong>Donald Trump signals major changes in U.S. trade diplomacy with India and Canada</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>Fresh Turmoil in U.S. Trade Policy</h2>
<p>More breaking developments are emerging from the <strong>United States of America</strong> concerning critical trade relations with both <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Canada</strong>. Former U.S. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> made headline-grabbing remarks that signal sweeping shifts in global economic diplomacy.</p>
<hr>
<h2>India Trade Deadline &#39;Not Fixed&#39;</h2>
<p>Speaking about the much-anticipated <strong>India-U.S. trade deal</strong>, Trump confirmed that the <strong>July 9 deadline is not set in stone</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We could do whatever we want—we could extend it, we could make it shorter. I’d like to make it shorter. I’d like to just send letters out to everybody: Congratulations, you’re paying 25%.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump reiterated that he wants <strong>India to remove all trade barriers</strong>, describing such a scenario as currently <strong>“unthinkable.”</strong> Despite the optimism, he conceded uncertainty, saying, <em>“I&#39;m not sure that is going to happen, but we agree that India and trade will be discussed.”</em></p>
<p>He acknowledged India as one of the <strong>early starters in trade negotiations</strong>, which he said he appreciated. However, <strong>U.S. businesses are still restricted</strong> in India, and his vision is of <strong>open, barrier-free access</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔁 Trump&#39;s Negotiation Pattern</h2>
<p>Trump’s comments mirror his well-known strategy of first <strong>announcing strict tariff measures</strong>, then <strong>opening doors to negotiations</strong>. He cited the <strong>U.S.–China trade war</strong>, which once saw tariffs spike up to <strong>145%</strong>, but eventually led to breakthrough negotiations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Initially he imposed... later they held rounds of negotiation and announced breakthroughs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump hopes for a similar trajectory with India, but noted that <strong>some tariff components are still pending U.S. court rulings</strong>. Congressional authority will also play a role in shaping the final agreement.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Trade Talks With Canada Halted</h2>
<p>In a separate development, Trump has <strong>halted all trade talks with Canada</strong>, branding it a <strong>&quot;difficult country to trade with.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The trigger: Canada’s <strong>Digital Services Tax</strong> targeting major American tech firms like <strong>Google, Amazon, and Meta</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Canada has been a very difficult country to deal with... they did something with our tech companies today trying to copy Europe. It’s not going to work out well for Canada.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trump claims the U.S. holds all the economic leverage and has warned that <strong>new tariffs will be imposed on Canada within seven days</strong> unless it “straightens out its act.”</p>
<p>The timing is significant—Trump had recently visited Canada and held a meeting with Prime Minister <strong>Mahkani</strong>. Upon his return, he announced this <strong>abrupt policy shift</strong> in a press conference on <strong>June 27</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Canada’s Digital Tax: The Flashpoint</h2>
<p>Trump cited <strong>Canada’s levy on digital revenue</strong> as the core reason for halting talks. He believes the tax unfairly targets American firms and considers the move a <strong>copycat action</strong> of similar European measures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They were foolish to do it... we have all the cards.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This move is seen as a <strong>major escalation in U.S.–Canada trade tensions</strong>, signaling a deepening rift over how digital economies should be taxed globally.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>The developments encapsulate Trump’s negotiation style—<strong>bold threats followed by flexible diplomacy</strong>. While the <strong>India-U.S. trade deal still holds promise</strong>, the path ahead remains uncertain due to internal legal hurdles. On the other hand, the <strong>Canada standoff marks a dramatic freeze</strong> in North American economic ties.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>India-U.S. trade deadline is now flexible</strong>, not locked to July 9.</li>
<li>Trump is pushing for <strong>removal of all trade barriers with India</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Canada trade talks terminated</strong> due to its <strong>Digital Services Tax</strong> on U.S. tech giants.</li>
<li><strong>New tariffs on Canadian goods may be imposed within a week.</strong></li>
<li>Trump’s approach reflects a mix of <strong>hardball tactics and deal-making instincts</strong>.</li>
</ul>
