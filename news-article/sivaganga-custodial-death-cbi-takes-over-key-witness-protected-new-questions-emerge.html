With the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) now officially in charge, new revelations and actions have pushed the incident into national focus once again.</p><h2>CBI Investigation Begins, FIR Awaited</h2><p>The CBI’s Special Crime Branch based in Delhi has been formally entrusted with the case. As per the Madras High Court's directive, the CBI is expected to file a formal FIR after receiving the district judge's report. The High Court has fixed <strong>August 20, 2025</strong>, as the deadline for the CBI to complete its investigation and submit the final report.</p><p>In a strong directive, the Court has also asked the CBI Director to appoint an Investigating Officer within one week of the case transfer. The CBI has been given authority to probe <strong>both the custodial death</strong> and the <strong>jewellery theft complaint</strong> that allegedly led to Ajith Kumar’s illegal detention.</p><h2>Judicial Inquiry Confirms Custodial Torture</h2><p>A report submitted by Madurai District Judge John Sundarlal Suresh has confirmed that Ajith Kumar died due to <strong>custodial torture</strong>. This finding reclassified the case from unnatural death to <strong>murder</strong>, invoking stricter sections under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.</p><p>The Court emphasized the urgency of the matter and ordered the CBI to:</p><ul><li>Collect all evidence already submitted in court</li><li>Register an FIR promptly</li><li>Submit a final post-mortem and pathology report</li><li>Ensure no delay from the Tamil Nadu government in assisting the probe</li></ul><h2>Eyewitness Seeks Protection After Threats</h2><p><strong>M. Sakthiswaran</strong>, a temple assistant who secretly filmed the assault on Ajith Kumar, submitted a formal complaint to the Tamil Nadu DGP, citing <strong>threats to his life</strong>. Following his plea and a court directive, police protection with armed guards has been provided to ensure his safety.</p><p>The judiciary also instructed authorities to implement the <strong>Witness Protection Scheme</strong>, extending coverage to other key witnesses and Ajith Kumar’s family.</p><h2>Contradictory Testimonies in Jewellery Theft Complaint</h2><p>The original complaint that led to Ajith’s illegal detention is now under scrutiny. <strong>Arun Kumar</strong>, an auto driver who transported the complainant (Nikitha), filed a petition stating that <strong>no gold was present in the vehicle</strong>, contradicting Nikitha’s allegations.</p><p>Political figures such as <strong>Naam Tamilar Katchi leader Seeman</strong> have publicly questioned why Nikitha has not been investigated. Seeman accused the state of selectively targeting the victim while shielding the complainant, calling the CBI handover a diversionary move.</p><h2>Medical Findings: Signs of Severe Torture</h2><p>The autopsy revealed <strong>44 injuries</strong> on Ajith Kumar’s body, including internal bleeding in vital organs such as the brain, heart, and abdomen. Doctors confirmed signs of brutal torture, including the application of irritants in sensitive areas. The findings align with video footage and eyewitness accounts submitted in court.</p><p>The Court described the post-mortem report as “shocking” and stated that “no organ was spared.” The case has now become a critical example of police brutality and abuse of custodial power.</p><h2>Action Against Police Personnel</h2><p>The Tamil Nadu government has suspended <strong>six police officers</strong>, while <strong>five of them</strong> — Prabhu, Kannan, Sankara Manikandan, Raja, and Anandan — have been arrested and are in judicial custody. Additionally:</p><ul><li>The <strong>Sivaganga District SP Ashish Rawat</strong> has been moved to a compulsory waitlist</li><li><strong>Ramnad District SP Sandeesh</strong> has been given additional charge of Sivaganga</li></ul><p>The Court directed that any senior officials responsible for authorizing the illegal detention must also be probed.</p><h2>Legal Oversight and Deadlines</h2><p>The Madras High Court’s Madurai Bench continues to monitor the investigation closely. Key developments include:</p><ul><li>CBI must complete the probe by <strong>August 20, 2025</strong></li><li>Tamil Nadu must assist with logistics and access to all case materials</li><li>Post-mortem and medical records must be finalized and submitted</li><li>All CCTV footage from temple, police station, and other locations must be preserved</li></ul><p>The judiciary has left the door open for future legal actions if lapses are found in either the state or CBI’s approach.</p><h2>Political Fallout and Public Reactions</h2><p>The case has triggered a wave of protests and political debates:</p><ul><li>Opposition parties accused the ruling government of negligence and demanded a higher compensation for Ajith’s family.</li><li>The Tamil Nadu government has officially supported the CBI transfer and expressed regret over the incident.</li><li>Public interest in the case continues to grow, with demands for systemic reforms in custodial handling, police accountability, and surveillance transparency.</li></ul><h2>Final Words</h2><p>The custodial death of Ajith Kumar is now a pivotal case in Tamil Nadu’s legal and human rights history. As the CBI proceeds with its investigation under judicial scrutiny, the state’s response and the eventual outcome may set precedent for handling future custodial deaths.</p><p>#JusticeforAjithkumar may take time—but the legal machinery is now in motion with national eyes watching closely.</p><div class="location-block">India | Tamilnadu | Sivagangai</div></div></div><div class="card mt-4 shadow-sm"><div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-center align-items-md-start p-3 gap-3"><div class="flex-shrink-0 text-center"><img src="https://ragadecode-media.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/media/ragavendran-ramesh-1.png" alt="Ragavendran Ramesh" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" width="64" height="64" loading="lazy"></div><div class="text-center text-md-start"><h5 class="card-title mb-1">Decoded by <strong>Raga</strong></h5><a href="/authors/ragavendran-ramesh" class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm">About Ragavendran Ramesh</a></div></div></div><a href="/" class="btn btn-outline-primary mt-4 d-inline-flex align-items-center"><i class="fas fa-arrow-left me-2"></i> Back to Home</a><div class="text-center mt-4 mb-4"><div id="affiliate-3-rectangle"></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-xl-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0"><section class="faq-section"><section class="faq-section"><h3 class="text-center mb-4">Quick Info</h3><div class="faq-item mb-4"><div class="faq-question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i> Who was Ajith Kumar and what happened to him?</div><div class="faq-answer mt-2">Ajith Kumar was a 25-year-old man from Sivaganga district, Tamil Nadu, who died while in police custody.
