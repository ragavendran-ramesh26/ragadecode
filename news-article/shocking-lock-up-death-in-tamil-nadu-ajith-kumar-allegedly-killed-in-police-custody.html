          <p>A disturbing case of police brutality has surfaced in Sivagangai district, Tamil Nadu, where a young man named Ajith Kumar reportedly died in police custody. The incident has triggered public outrage, legal action, and demands for justice after a shocking video was submitted to the court.</p>
<h2>Custodial Death Captured on Video</h2>
<p>Ajith Kumar, who worked as a temple watchman at Kaliyamman temple in Madapuram, was allegedly taken by police officers behind the temple and brutally assaulted. A video showing the incident was recorded by a temple worker named Sakthi Kumar and later submitted as evidence to the court.</p>
<h2>Legal Action and Investigation</h2>
<p>Initially filed as a complaint, the case was reclassified as a murder after widespread backlash. The Tamil Nadu government transferred the investigation to the CB-CID (Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department), and the Madurai Bench of the High Court is now handling the proceedings.</p>
<p>The court questioned delays in submitting Ajith Kumar&#39;s postmortem report and noted the disturbing nature of the video evidence. There are calls to further escalate the case to the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) for an unbiased probe.</p>
<h2>Court Orders and Witness Protection</h2>
<p>During the hearings, it was revealed that the person who recorded the video, Sakthi Kumar, is allegedly facing continuous threats from police. The judges ordered his protection and directed him to appear in court for further testimony.</p>
<p>Judges also recommended ₹50 lakh compensation to Ajith Kumar’s family, acknowledging the serious nature of the allegations and the impact on the victim’s loved ones.</p>
<h2>Public and Legal Pressure</h2>
<p>Lawyers including Mari Kumar and Arun filed petitions seeking justice for Ajith. Public sentiment remains strong, with citizens and activists demanding accountability and transparency in police conduct.</p>
<h2>Next Hearing Scheduled</h2>
<p>The next court hearing has been scheduled for 3 PM 1st July 2025, where more evidence and testimonies are expected to be reviewed. The outcome could influence how custodial death cases are handled in the future.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ajith Kumar’s death has spotlighted the harsh realities of custodial violence in India. With strong judicial oversight and mounting public pressure, there is hope that justice will be served in this tragic case.</p>
<h2>Full Breakdown of the Incident &amp; High Court&#39;s Response</h2>
