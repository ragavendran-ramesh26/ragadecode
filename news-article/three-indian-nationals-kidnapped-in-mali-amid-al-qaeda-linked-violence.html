                            <p>Three Indian nationals have been kidnapped in the African country of Mali. The incident happened on July 1, 2025, when armed attackers stormed a cement factory where the Indians were working. This has raised serious concern in India, with the government taking immediate diplomatic action.</p>
<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>The three Indians were working at <strong>Diamond Cement Factory</strong> in <strong>Kayes, western Mali</strong>. On <strong>July 1</strong>, an armed group attacked the factory and abducted them. The factory was not the only target that day — several regions in Mali saw <strong>coordinated attacks</strong> by terrorists linked to <strong>Al-Qaeda</strong>, particularly the group <strong>JNIM</strong> (Jama’at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin).</p>
<p>So far, <strong>no group has officially claimed responsibility</strong> for this specific kidnapping. However, the timing and location suggest a possible link to these wider attacks.</p>
<h2>India&#39;s Immediate Response</h2>
<p>The <strong>Indian Ministry of External Affairs</strong> (MEA) strongly condemned the incident. The government described the act as “<strong>deplorable</strong>” and urged the <strong>Malian authorities</strong> to take quick action for the <strong>safe return</strong> of the kidnapped workers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Indian Embassy in Mali</strong> is:</p>
<ul>
<li>In touch with local police and factory officials.</li>
<li>Speaking directly with the families of the kidnapped men.</li>
<li>Actively involved in tracking the situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advisory for Indians in Mali</h2>
<p>The Indian government has issued a <strong>safety advisory</strong> for all Indian citizens living or working in Mali. They’ve been told to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay <strong>alert</strong>.</li>
<li>Remain in contact with the <strong>Indian Embassy</strong>.</li>
<li>Avoid <strong>traveling alone</strong> or going to unsafe areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>This step comes as tensions in Mali remain high due to growing terror threats.</p>
<h2>Background: Who is Behind the Violence?</h2>
<p>The group <strong>JNIM</strong>, linked to Al-Qaeda, is active in the region and often targets military and foreign interests. On July 1, they launched <strong>multiple attacks across Mali</strong>, including on police stations and military posts. Though they haven’t claimed the kidnapping of the Indians, many believe they are involved because of the timing.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This kidnapping highlights the <strong>dangers Indian workers face</strong> in unstable regions like Mali. The Indian government is actively working to bring them home safely. Meanwhile, Indians in Mali are urged to stay cautious and connected with the Embassy for updates.</p>
