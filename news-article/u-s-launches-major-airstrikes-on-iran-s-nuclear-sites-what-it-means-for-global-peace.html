                        <span style="font-size: 14px;
    color: grey;">Published on: 22 Jun 2025 </span>
                        <img class="cover-image" src="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/medium_Screenshot_2025_06_22_at_4_15_48_PM_cd133e5d72.png" alt="U.S. Launches Major Airstrikes on Iran’s Nuclear Sites: What It Means for Global Peace" loading="lazy" />

                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p>In a major military action, the <strong>United States has confirmed airstrikes on three key nuclear facilities in Iran</strong>. The mission, supported by Israel and personally endorsed by former U.S. President <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, is already being described as one of the most powerful and precise air attacks in recent decades.</p>
<p>The strikes targeted Iran&#39;s nuclear enrichment sites in <strong>Natanz, Fordow, and Esfahan</strong> — locations long believed to be developing <strong>nuclear weapons capability</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What Happened?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The U.S. used <strong>B2 stealth bombers</strong> armed with <strong>GBU-57 bunker-busting bombs</strong></li>
<li>Each bomb weighs <strong>13,600 kg</strong>, designed to penetrate and destroy underground facilities</li>
<li>The mission was <strong>fully successful</strong>, according to official sources</li>
<li>Iran’s nuclear infrastructure has been <strong>completely destroyed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This marks the first time such a deep underground strike has been carried out with this level of <strong>precision and speed</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Role of Israel</h3>
<p>Israel&#39;s Prime Minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, applauded the operation. He called it a <strong>historic moment</strong>, thanking President Trump and the American military for “doing what no other country could do.”</p>
<p>Netanyahu emphasized that this strike wasn’t just for Israel — but for the <strong>security of the entire Middle East and the world</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Trump&#39;s Statement</h3>
<p>In a detailed televised speech, former President Trump said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tonight, the U.S. military carried out <strong>precision strikes</strong> on Iran’s key nuclear sites. Our mission was to eliminate Iran’s nuclear enrichment capability — and we succeeded.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Iran’s nuclear threat is no longer.”</li>
<li>“They must now choose peace, or face even greater consequences.”</li>
<li>“This is a turning point in history.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Trump also thanked the <strong>Joint Chiefs of Staff</strong>, the <strong>U.S. Air Force</strong>, and the <strong>Israeli military</strong> for their cooperation.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>According to Trump, Iran was <strong>days away from building operational nuclear weapons</strong>. Intelligence reports suggested these weapons could threaten not just Israel but the wider region.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If we had waited any longer, Israel would have been in danger of total destruction,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For years, Iran has been accused of secretly developing nuclear weapons while publicly denying it. The U.S. has now taken <strong>direct military action to stop it</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What’s Next?</h3>
<p>Trump warned Iran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If they do not seek peace now, future attacks will be faster, larger, and more deadly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He made it clear that this was <strong>only the first phase</strong> of potential action. Other suspected sites have been identified and could be targeted next.</p>
<p>A Pentagon press conference was scheduled the following morning to give more technical and strategic details.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Global Impact</h3>
<p>This strike will have <strong>global consequences</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other nations may now reconsider their stance on Iran</li>
<li>The <strong>UN Security Council</strong> is expected to hold an emergency session</li>
<li>Tensions between <strong>U.S.–Iran</strong> and <strong>Iran–Israel</strong> may escalate further</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the risks, U.S. and Israeli officials claim the mission was necessary to <strong>protect global peace</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Final Words</h3>
<p>President Trump ended his speech by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We love our military. We love God. And we love peace.<br>But peace only comes through strength.<br>May God bless the Middle East, Israel, and America.”</p>
</blockquote>
