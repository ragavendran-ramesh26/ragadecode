                        <span style="font-size: 14px;
    color: grey;">Published on: 22 Jun 2025 </span>
                        

                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p>The aftermath of the tragic Air India crash continues to send shockwaves through India&#39;s aviation sector. In a bold and immediate response, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has issued orders to terminate three senior officials from Air India, citing negligence in duty that may have contributed to the catastrophic incident.</p>
<h2>Investigation Focus: Black Box Holds the Truth</h2>
<p>At the center of this investigation is the aircraft‚Äôs <strong>black box</strong>‚Äîwhich includes the <strong>Flight Data Recorder (FDR)</strong> and the <strong>Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR)</strong>. Authorities confirmed both components suffered damage, particularly to the outer casing of one unit. These devices are crucial in uncovering the real cause behind the crash.</p>
<p>While rumors and unverified posts on social media have attempted to speculate the cause, officials urge the public to <strong>wait for official analysis</strong>. Extracting the binary data from the damaged recorders and converting it into readable engineering formats may take several days or weeks, but it is vital to determining the root cause.</p>
<h2>DGCA&#39;s Tough Call: Accountability Comes First</h2>
<p>Citing violations in <strong>pilot duty time regulations</strong>, DGCA has accused the airline of allowing pilots to fly beyond permitted flight hours, risking safety. The three terminated officials were reportedly responsible for oversight in these areas. DGCA emphasized that even minor negligence would be treated seriously in light of the magnitude of the crash.</p>
<p>This disciplinary action does not imply that these officials are directly responsible for the crash, but DGCA stated it was a <strong>standard protocol</strong> following any major incident to ensure accountability and transparency.</p>
<h2>Rumors Debunked: No Official Cause Yet</h2>
<p>Following the crash, several viral social media posts claimed that the cause of the accident had already been discovered. However, <strong>India‚Äôs Press Information Bureau (PIB)</strong> and DGCA have issued clarifications labeling these posts as false. The investigation is still underway, and the <strong>black box analysis is pending</strong>.</p>
<p>Some sources suggest that the component damage may have been caused during impact when the aircraft hit the ground. Authorities are carefully deciding whether to open the damaged units for analysis, fearing any mishandling could lead to irreversible data loss.</p>
<h2>üåç Global and Domestic Collaboration for Analysis</h2>
<p>To expedite the process, India is considering four possible paths for black box analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Lucknow</strong></li>
<li><strong>National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), USA</strong></li>
<li><strong>Civil Aviation Authority, United Kingdom</strong></li>
<li><strong>Singapore Safety Board</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Experts believe a decision will be made soon to choose the most capable agency to recover and decode the critical flight data.</p>
<h2>Flight Cancellations Add to Public Frustration</h2>
<p>Amid the crisis, <strong>eight domestic flights</strong> were suddenly canceled at <strong>Chennai International Airport</strong>, including those from Air India and SpiceJet. Affected passengers expressed outrage over the lack of advance notice. Airlines merely cited &quot;administrative reasons&quot; without further explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Departures Canceled:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Chennai to Mumbai (Air India)</li>
<li>Chennai to Delhi (Air India)</li>
<li>Chennai to Tuticorin (SpiceJet)</li>
<li>Chennai to Delhi (Air India ‚Äì 2nd instance)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arrivals Canceled:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hyderabad to Chennai (SpiceJet)</li>
<li>Delhi to Chennai (Air India)</li>
<li>Tuticorin to Chennai</li>
<li>Delhi to Chennai (Air India)</li>
</ul>
<p>These cancellations have sparked criticism, with many calling for better communication and contingency plans from airlines.</p>
<h2>Public Concern: This Should Not Be Another &quot;Unsolved Mystery&quot;</h2>
<p>The tragedy has reminded many of the <strong>Malaysia Airlines MH370</strong> case, a disaster still shrouded in mystery. Citizens and aviation experts alike stress that this must not be repeated. Transparency, urgency, and clear answers are demanded from both Air India and the Indian aviation authorities.</p>
<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Black box recovery and data conversion are ongoing.</li>
<li>A decision on international collaboration for data analysis is imminent.</li>
<li>DGCA is expected to issue interim reports.</li>
<li>Flight safety regulations are likely to be revisited.</li>
<li>Air India may face further administrative scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>As families grieve and the nation seeks answers, one truth stands firm: aviation safety must be paramount. Accountability, transparency, and swift corrective action are the need of the hour. This is not just about one crash‚Äîit‚Äôs about restoring trust in the Indian skies.</p>
