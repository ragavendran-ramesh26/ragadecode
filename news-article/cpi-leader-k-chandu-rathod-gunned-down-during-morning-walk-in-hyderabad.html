          <p>On the morning of July 15, 2025, Hyderabad woke to shocking news: senior Communist Party of India (CPI) leader K. Chandu Rathod was brutally gunned down in a public park during his daily walk. The incident, which occurred in Shalivahana Nagar Park near Dilsukhnagar, has since unfolded into a complex murder investigation involving land disputes, political rivalries, and nine named suspects. </p>
<h2>WHO WAS CHANDU RATHOD?</h2>
<p><img src="https://ragadecode-media.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/media/cpi-chandru.jpeg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
<p><strong>K. Chandu Rathod</strong>, also known as Chandu Naik, was a 47-year-old CPI city/state council leader based in Hyderabad. Known for his stronghold in land activism, he had previously been accused in two separate murder cases. Despite his controversial history, Rathod remained an influential political figure, actively involved in community issues and land rights.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife Naarabai, daughter Sindhu, and a son studying in Canada.</p>
<p><strong>Suspects:</strong> <a href="https://ragadecode.com/locations/india/telangana/hyderabad">Hyderabad</a> police have named <strong>nine individuals</strong> in the murder case. The central figure among them is <strong>Rajesh</strong>, a former friend and political associate of Rathod. The two allegedly had a major fallout over illegal land dealings in the city.</p>
<hr>
<h2>THE CRUCIAL MOMENTS: WHEN THE ASSASSINATION UNFOLDED</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Date of Incident:</strong> Tuesday, July 15, 2025  </li>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Approximately 7:20 AM – 7:30 AM</li>
</ul>
<p>Rathod was reportedly concluding his routine morning walk when he was ambushed and shot dead.</p>
<hr>
<h2>THE CRIME SCENE: WHERE RATHOD FELL</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> Shalivahana Nagar Park, located near Malakpet and Dilsukhnagar in Hyderabad.</li>
</ul>
<p>The attack occurred just outside the park gate near Rathod’s parked vehicle. It’s a popular area frequented by morning joggers and walkers.</p>
<p>His body was later shifted to Osmania General Hospital for post-mortem examination.</p>
<hr>
<h2>THE METHOD OF MURDER: WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PARK?</h2>
<p><strong>The Attack:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Rathod was approached by 3–4 assailants who arrived in a white Maruti Swift.</li>
<li>They threw <strong>chilli powder</strong> into his eyes to blind and disorient him.</li>
<li>Then, they fired <strong>seven rounds</strong>, of which <strong>five bullets</strong> hit him in the head, chest, and arm.</li>
<li>The attackers fled the scene immediately in the same car.</li>
</ul>
<p>The park initially erupted in panic. Witnesses thought the gunshots were from a car backfiring until Rathod’s body was discovered moments later.</p>
<hr>
<h2>THE ROOT CAUSE: WHY WAS RATHOD TARGETED?</h2>
<p><strong>Motive: Land Dispute</strong></p>
<p>The root of the conflict appears to lie in a bitter land dispute involving 100 acres of <strong>Bhoodan land</strong> in the Kuntloor region. Rathod had opposed Rajesh, who was allegedly extorting hut dwellers with false promises of land ownership.</p>
<p>The disagreement between them escalated after Rathod reportedly exposed Rajesh’s misdeeds, leading to his expulsion from CPI(ML) in 2022. Since then, tension had been brewing.</p>
<p>While the police are treating the murder as a result of personal rivalry, some within the CPI party suggest political motivations may also be involved.</p>
<hr>
<h2>THE PURSUIT FOR JUSTICE: HOW POLICE ARE RESPONDING</h2>
<p><strong>Investigation Highlights:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A case has been registered under various sections of criminal law, including murder and conspiracy.</li>
<li>Police recovered <strong>3 bullet shells</strong>, <strong>2 live rounds</strong>, and traces of <strong>chilli powder</strong> from the scene.</li>
<li>A white Swift car used in the getaway was recovered from a rental agency in Kothapet.</li>
<li>GPS data, CCTV footage, and forensic analysis are underway to establish the timeline and roles of each suspect.</li>
<li>Over <strong>10 police teams</strong> have been deployed, including crime scene units, dog squads, and surveillance teams.</li>
<li>As of now, <strong>the primary accused remain at large</strong> and are believed to have switched off their phones to avoid tracking.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>TIMELINE AT A GLANCE</h2>

    <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
        <thead><tr><th>Time</th><th>Event</th></tr></thead>
        <tbody><tr><td>6:30 AM</td><td>Rathod begins his walk with wife and daughter at Shalivahana Nagar Park</td></tr><tr><td>7:20 AM</td><td>Wife and daughter return home; Rathod lingers near gate</td></tr><tr><td>7:30 AM</td><td>Assailants attack using chilli powder and firearms</td></tr><tr><td>8:00 AM</td><td>Police arrive; evidence is secured and investigation launched</td></tr><tr><td>July 16–17</td><td>Nine suspects identified; vehicle traced; hunt for main accused continues</td></tr></tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  <hr>
<h2>THE AFTERSHOCKS: WHAT’S HAPPENING NOW?</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Manhunt Intensifies</strong> – The search for Rajesh and other absconding suspects is ongoing. Police are using mobile tracking and local informants to locate them.</li>
<li><strong>Political Fallout</strong> – CPI and CPI(ML) factions are on high alert. Public statements indicate rising tension.</li>
<li><strong>Security Concerns</strong> – Morning walkers and park-goers have expressed safety concerns. There are calls for increased patrolling.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Complexity</strong> – Rathod’s own legal history complicates the narrative. He was reportedly under investigation for land grabs and was an accused in two previous homicide cases.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>THE CITY REACTS: PUBLIC OUTCRY AND FEAR</h2>
<p>The murder has left Hyderabad stunned. A daylight assassination in a public space has triggered conversations around political violence, land mafia activity, and civic safety.</p>
<p>Residents in Malakpet and Dilsukhnagar have demanded stronger policing in public parks. Meanwhile, CPI party members have paid homage to Rathod, calling for swift justice.</p>
<hr>
<h2>FINAL THOUGHTS: WHY THIS CASE MATTERS</h2>
<p>The killing of K. Chandu Rathod highlights the dangerous nexus of land politics, personal enmity, and party rivalries in urban India. While the police have made quick strides in identifying suspects and collecting evidence, the primary accused remain at large.</p>
<p>As Hyderabad watches closely, this case serves as a sobering reminder of how disputes over land can spiral into violent, irreversible outcomes.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further developments on arrests, court hearings, and motive revelations.</p>
