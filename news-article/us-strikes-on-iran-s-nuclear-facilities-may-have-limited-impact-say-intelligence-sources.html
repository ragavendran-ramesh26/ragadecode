                        <img class="cover-image" src="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/medium_b_2_bomber_0e5b24375b.webp" alt="U.S. Strikes on Iran's Nuclear Facilities May Have Limited Impact, Say Intelligence Sources" loading="lazy" />

                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p>A preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment reveals that the recent American airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities may have only delayed its nuclear program by a few months. This finding starkly contrasts with the bold claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who earlier declared that Iran’s nuclear ambitions had been “obliterated.”</p>
<h2>Contradictory Assessments Emerge</h2>
<p>According to three sources familiar with the classified assessment, the weekend bombing campaign, touted as a decisive blow, may not have significantly disrupted Iran’s progress. One of the sources revealed that Iran&#39;s enriched uranium stocks remain intact, and the operational setback to its nuclear program may span just one or two months.</p>
<p>This assessment appears to challenge the Trump administration&#39;s narrative. Trump previously stated that the strikes were critical to thwarting Iran from developing a nuclear weapon — an accusation Iran continues to deny. Tehran maintains that its nuclear activities are strictly for peaceful, civilian purposes.</p>
<h2>Pentagon Pushes Back</h2>
<p>Despite the intelligence findings, the Pentagon has disputed claims of limited success. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth emphasized in a statement to Reuters:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Based on everything we have seen — and I’ve seen it all — our bombing campaign obliterated Iran&#39;s ability to create nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, a U.S. official speaking anonymously acknowledged that the extent of the damage remains unclear, and the assessment has sparked internal disagreement within the intelligence community.</p>
<h2>White House Reaction</h2>
<p>While the White House has yet to provide an official comment, Press Secretary Caroline Leavitt responded to CNN’s inquiry, strongly denying the report and calling the assessment “flat-out wrong.”</p>
<h2>Strategic Uncertainty Lingers</h2>
<p>As the situation unfolds, experts caution that the discrepancy between political claims and intelligence evaluations could create policy confusion and diplomatic tension. The muted effectiveness of the strikes, if confirmed, suggests that Iran&#39;s nuclear infrastructure remains resilient — and that the path to disarmament may be far more complex than anticipated.</p>
