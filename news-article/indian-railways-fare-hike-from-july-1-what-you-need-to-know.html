                            <p><strong>New Delhi, July 1, 2025</strong> - Indian Railways has introduced a revised fare structure effective today, marking the first fare increase since the COVID-19 pandemic. The move aims to offset rising operational costs while funding infrastructure upgrades, with minimal impact on most passengers.</p>
<h2>Revised Fare Structure Details</h2>
<p><img src="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/Screenshot_2025_07_01_at_10_34_44_AM_b7b9e74307.png" alt="irctc-indianrailways-fare-hike"></p>
<h3>Class-wise Incremental Increases</h3>
<p>Passengers traveling in Non-AC Mail and Express trains will now pay an additional 1 paisa per kilometer. For those opting for air-conditioned travel across all classes including AC Chair Car, 3AC, 2AC and Executive, the increase will be 2 paise per kilometer. Sleeper and First Class ordinary travelers will see a modest hike of 0.5 paisa per kilometer.</p>
<h3>Distance-based Adjustments</h3>
<p>For second class travel, the railways has introduced fixed increases based on distance brackets. Journeys up to 500 km remain unaffected, while 501-1500 km trips will cost ₹5 more. Longer travels of 1501-2500 km and 2501-3000 km will see increases of ₹10 and ₹15 respectively.</p>
<h3>Suburban Travel Unchanged</h3>
<p>In a relief to daily commuters, suburban single journey tickets and monthly season passes will maintain their current pricing structure. This decision ensures that the fare hike doesn&#39;t burden those relying on local train services for their daily commute.</p>
<h2>New Aadhaar Requirement for Tatkal Bookings</h2>
<p>Indian Railways has made Aadhaar verification mandatory for all Tatkal ticket bookings starting today. This measure aims to combat ticket fraud and black-market activities, ensuring fair access to last-minute travel options for genuine passengers.</p>
<h2>Rationale Behind the Hike</h2>
<p>Railway officials explain that the modest increases are necessary to maintain service quality amid rising operational costs, including fuel and maintenance expenses. &quot;We&#39;ve carefully calibrated these hikes to minimize impact while ensuring we can continue upgrading our services,&quot; a spokesperson stated.</p>
<h2>Passenger Reactions</h2>
<p>Early responses from travelers have been mixed but generally understanding. Regular Rajdhani Express passenger Rajesh Kumar noted, &quot;While any increase affects budgets, a 2-paise per km hike seems reasonable if it leads to better services.&quot; Daily suburban commuters expressed relief at being excluded from the fare revision.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Passengers are advised to check updated fares on official IRCTC platforms before booking. The Railways Ministry has also hinted at upcoming digital initiatives to further streamline ticketing processes and improve passenger experience in the coming months.</p>
