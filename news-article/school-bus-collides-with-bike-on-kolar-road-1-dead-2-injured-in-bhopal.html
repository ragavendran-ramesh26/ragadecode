class="content-markdown"><p>A tragic road accident in Bhopal’s Kolar area claimed the life of a 47-year-old man and left two of his relatives critically injured after a school bus collided with their motorcycle. The incident occurred on <strong>Wednesday afternoon, July 16</strong>, near a private school on the city’s busy six-lane Kolar Road. The crash has reignited public concerns about road safety in school zones.</p><hr><h2>Victim Identified as Naresh Karma</h2><p>The deceased has been identified as <strong>Naresh Karma</strong>, a 47-year-old resident of <strong>Jagun Chapri village in Sehore district</strong>. He worked at a factory in <strong>Anand Nagar</strong>, Bhopal, and lived on the factory premises. On the day of the incident, he was returning to Bhopal after delivering money to his mother in his native village.</p><p>Naresh was traveling with his <strong>niece, Santoshi (21)</strong>, and a <strong>relative, Hariom (40)</strong> — both fellow factory workers — when the tragedy struck.</p><hr><h2>The Accident: What Happened?</h2><p>According to <strong>Sub-Inspector Sunil Invati</strong>, the trio was riding from Kolar toward Anand Nagar when a <strong>school bus suddenly turned at a cut-point near a private school</strong> and collided with their motorcycle.</p><p>The <strong>impact was severe</strong>, throwing all three riders off the vehicle. <strong>Naresh sustained fatal head injuries</strong> and died on the spot. Santoshi and Hariom were immediately rushed to a private hospital by police. Hariom is reportedly in <strong>critical condition</strong>, while Santoshi is recovering under medical supervision.</p><hr><h2>Police Action and Investigation</h2><p><strong>Kolar police</strong> arrived at the accident site promptly upon receiving information. The <strong>school bus was seized</strong>, and the <strong>driver was arrested</strong>.</p><p>A case has been registered under relevant sections of the law, and <strong>Naresh's body was sent for post-mortem</strong>. Police are also examining <strong>CCTV footage</strong> and gathering <strong>witness statements</strong> to determine the exact cause and sequence of events.</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“We are verifying the driver’s documents and vehicle compliance records. Preliminary evidence suggests negligent turning behavior at a critical road junction,” said a police official involved in the investigation.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>Timeline Overview</h2><ul><li><strong>Wednesday afternoon (July 16, 2025):</strong> School bus turns at cut-point, collides with motorcycle</li><li><strong>Immediately after:</strong> Victims thrown onto road; Naresh dies at scene</li><li><strong>Shortly after:</strong> Kolar police respond, transport injured to hospital, seize bus, and arrest driver</li><li><strong>Later that day:</strong> Post-mortem initiated; case registered</li></ul><hr><h2>Public Reaction and Safety Concerns</h2><p>This is not an isolated incident. In May, Bhopal witnessed another school bus accident caused by a signal violation, prompting public outcry. The latest crash has triggered fresh concerns among residents and commuters, especially in densely populated areas like Kolar Road.</p><p>Locals have pointed out a <strong>lack of road signage</strong>, <strong>absence of speed breakers</strong>, and <strong>dangerous driving during school hours</strong> as persistent problems.</p><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>“The road is used by children, parents, and factory workers daily. These sharp turns and fast buses are a deadly combination,” said a resident who witnessed the aftermath.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>What Needs to Be Done?</h2><p><strong>Urban safety experts</strong> are urging authorities to act promptly. Recommended measures include:</p><ul><li>Implementing <strong>compulsory training for school bus drivers</strong></li><li>Installing <strong>CCTV and automated speed monitors</strong> in school zones</li><li>Adding <strong>designated turn lanes, signage, and speed bumps</strong> in accident-prone areas like Kolar Road</li></ul><hr><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The untimely death of Naresh Karma has left a family grieving and a city demanding answers. While police continue their investigation and the injured remain under care, this incident once again exposes the <strong>urgent need for safer school zone infrastructure and stronger traffic enforcement</strong>.</p><p>Bhopal’s growing population and rapid urban sprawl require equally responsive road safety planning — before another life is lost on its roads.</p><div class="location-block">India | Madhya Pradesh | Bhopal</div></div></div><div><div class="d-flex flex-wrap gap-2 justify-content-center"><div class="text-center"><h5 class="mb-3">Share this article</h5><div class="share-buttons"><a href="https://wa.me/?text=School%20Bus%20Collides%20with%20Bike%20on%20Kolar%20Road%3A%201%20Dead%2C%202%20Injured%20in%20Bhopal%20https%3A%2F%2Fragadecode.com%2Fnews-article%2Fschool-bus-collides-with-bike-on-kolar-road-1-dead-2-injured-in-bhopal%3Futm_source%3Dwhatsapp%26utm_medium%3Dshare_button%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial_share" target="_blank" class="btn btn-success" aria-label="Share on WhatsApp"><i class="fab fa-whatsapp"></i><span>WhatsApp</span> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fragadecode.com%2Fnews-article%2Fschool-bus-collides-with-bike-on-kolar-road-1-dead-2-injured-in-bhopal%3Futm_source%3Dtwitter%26utm_medium%3Dshare_button%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial_share&text=School%20Bus%20Collides%20with%20Bike%20on%20Kolar%20Road%3A%201%20Dead%2C%202%20Injured%20in%20Bhopal" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary" aria-label="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i><span>Twitter</span> </a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fragadecode.com%2Fnews-article%2Fschool-bus-collides-with-bike-on-kolar-road-1-dead-2-injured-in-bhopal%3Futm_source%3Dfacebook%26utm_medium%3Dshare_button%26utm_campaign%3Dsocial_share" target="_blank" class="btn btn-info" aria-label="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook-f"></i><span>Facebook</span> </a><button onclick='copyToClipboard("https://ragadecode.com/news-article/school-bus-collides-with-bike-on-kolar-road-1-dead-2-injured-in-bhopal?utm_source=copy_link&utm_medium=share_button&utm_campaign=social_share")' class="btn btn-dark" aria-label="Copy Link"><i class="fas fa-link"></i><span>Copy</span></button></div><div id="copy-toast">Link copied!</div></div><script>function copyToClipboard(o){navigator.clipboard.writeText(o).then(()=>{const o=document.getElementById("copy-toast");o.style.display="block",setTimeout(()=>{o.style.display="none"},2e3)}).catch(o=>{console.error("Failed to copy: ",o)})}</script></div><div class="justify-content-center text-center mt-3"><p class="fw-bold">You can now subscribe free to our RagaDecode whatsapp channel for updates</p><a href="https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb5muIZ89inmjau8hy2j" target="_blank" class="btn btn-success btn-sm rounded-pill px-3"><i class="fab fa-whatsapp me-1"></i> Subscribe</a></div></div><div class="card mt-4 shadow-sm"><div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-center align-items-md-start p-3 gap-3"><div class="flex-shrink-0 text-center"><img src="https://ragadecode-media.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/media/ragavendran-ramesh-1.png" alt="Ragavendran Ramesh" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" width="64" height="64" loading="lazy"></div><div class="text-center text-md-start"><h5 class="card-title mb-1">Decoded by <strong>Raga</strong></h5><a href="/authors/ragavendran-ramesh" class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm">About Ragavendran Ramesh</a></div></div></div><a href="/" class="btn btn-outline-primary mt-4 d-inline-flex align-items-center"><i class="fas fa-arrow-left me-2"></i> Back to Home</a><div class="text-center mt-4 mb-4"><div id="affiliate-3-rectangle"></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-xl-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0"><section id="faq" class="faq-section"><section class="faq-section"><h3 class="text-center mb-4">Quick Info</h3><div class="faq-item mb-4"><div class="faq-question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i> Who was the victim in the Bhopal school bus accident?</div><div class="faq-answer mt-2">The victim was Naresh Karma, a 47-year-old factory worker from Jagun Chapri village in Sehore district.
