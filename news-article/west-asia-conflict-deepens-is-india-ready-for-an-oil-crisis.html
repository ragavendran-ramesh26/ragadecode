                            <h2>⛽ Rising Tensions, Rising Prices</h2>
<p>The West Asia conflict is spiraling, and the <strong>biggest risk India now faces is its oil supply stability</strong>. As Iran threatens retaliation and regional unrest spreads, oil prices have already reacted — touching a <strong>five-month high</strong> before easing slightly. However, the risk remains high and any further escalation could send prices soaring again.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔍 India’s Heavy Dependence on West Asian Oil</h2>
<p>India is the <strong>third-largest oil consumer in the world</strong>, and its dependency on oil imports is significant. Over <strong>40% of its oil</strong> comes from West Asia, making regional security a matter of direct national interest. </p>
<p>Of the <strong>5.5 million barrels India consumes daily</strong>, between <strong>1.5 and 2 million barrels pass through the Strait of Hormuz</strong> — a narrow but strategic waterway that has been the focus of multiple geopolitical threats.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🚢 Why the Strait of Hormuz Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>Strait of Hormuz</strong> is a critical chokepoint in global oil trade. Around <strong>20% of the world’s oil supply</strong>, approximately <strong>20 million barrels per day</strong>, passes through this corridor.</p>
<p>Iran has <strong>threatened to close the Strait</strong> — a move that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disrupt oil supply routes globally</li>
<li>Create an <strong>artificial oil shortage</strong></li>
<li>Lead to <strong>surging inflation</strong>, especially in oil-importing countries like India and the United States</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, this strategy is a double-edged sword. Iran too relies on this route to export oil, especially to China, which <strong>buys 90% of Iran’s oil</strong>. Closing the Strait would therefore inflict economic damage on Iran itself.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🇮🇳 India’s Strategy to Navigate the Oil Risk</h2>
<p>Despite no longer buying oil directly from Iran due to sanctions, <strong>India is vulnerable to any disruptions</strong> in the Strait of Hormuz, especially from countries like Iraq, UAE, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>India’s Energy Minister, <strong>Hardeep Singh Puri</strong>, has assured that the country is <strong>prepared to handle any potential supply shocks</strong>:</p>
<h3>🛢️ Diversified Imports</h3>
<ul>
<li>India is <strong>ramping up imports from Russia</strong> — currently importing <strong>over 2 million barrels per day</strong> from Russia, overtaking West Asia in monthly share.</li>
<li><strong>Purchases from the U.S.</strong> have also increased.</li>
</ul>
<h3>🛢️ Strategic Oil Reserves</h3>
<ul>
<li>India holds <strong>74 days&#39; worth of oil in storage</strong>, covering over <strong>two months of consumption</strong> — a crucial buffer during supply chain shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>🧭 The Road Ahead</h2>
<p>India&#39;s ability to <strong>diversify suppliers</strong> and build strong <strong>strategic oil reserves</strong> has proven useful in past global crises. But the <strong>current West Asian tensions</strong> will be a significant test of this resilience.</p>
<p>For a country as energy-hungry and globally integrated as India, <strong>maintaining multiple reliable oil partners</strong> is no longer a strategy — it&#39;s a survival necessity. As global powers jostle in the volatile oil landscape, <strong>India must continue strengthening its energy independence, diplomatic engagement, and emergency preparedness</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Oil is not just an economic commodity — it&#39;s a <strong>geopolitical instrument</strong>. While the current crisis in West Asia threatens to disrupt global markets, <strong>India’s proactive diversification and strategic foresight</strong> may cushion the blow.</p>
<p>Still, in a world where oil routes can become warzones overnight, <strong>vigilance, diplomacy, and preparedness</strong> are India’s best tools to weather the storm.</p>
