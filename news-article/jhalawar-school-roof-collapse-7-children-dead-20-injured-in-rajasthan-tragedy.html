px-lg-3 mt-4 mb-5"><div class="content-markdown"><p>In a heart-wrenching incident that has sparked outrage across <a href="https://ragadecode.com/locations/india/rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, a government school roof collapse in <strong>Piplodi village, Jhalawar district</strong>, claimed the lives of <strong>seven school children</strong> and left more than <strong>twenty others injured</strong> on the morning of <strong>July 25, 2025</strong>. This devastating event has raised urgent concerns about the structural safety of government schools across the state.</p><h2>What Happened?</h2><p>At approximately <strong>7:40 AM</strong>, during the start of the school day, a section of the roof in the <strong>Piplodi Government Upper Primary School</strong> caved in. Students from <strong>grades 6 to 8</strong> had gathered inside the classroom when the structure suddenly collapsed, trapping dozens of them under debris.</p><p>The students were reportedly just minutes away from the morning assembly. Eyewitness accounts reveal that <strong>gravel and dust had been falling from the ceiling</strong> earlier that morning, prompting a few students to <strong>alert their teacher</strong>. However, their warnings allegedly went unheeded.</p><h2>Who Are the Victims?</h2><p>The deceased include <strong>seven children</strong>, all aged between <strong>6 and 13 years</strong>, with names such as Payal, Priyanka, Kundan, Kartik, and Harish confirmed by local media. At least <strong>21 other children sustained injuries</strong>, with <strong>10 in critical condition</strong>, being treated at hospitals in <strong>Jhalawar, Kota</strong>, and <strong>Navi Mumbai</strong>.</p><h2>Where Did It Occur?</h2><p>The incident took place in <strong>Piplodi</strong>, a remote village in the <strong>Jhalawar district of Rajasthan</strong>, inside a government school that serves children from surrounding rural communities. The classroom that collapsed was reportedly <strong>built in 1994</strong> and had not undergone significant structural repairs in recent years.</p><h2>When Did the Collapse Occur?</h2><ul><li><strong>Date</strong>: July 25, 2025</li><li><strong>Time</strong>: ~7:40 AM IST</li><li><strong>Occasion</strong>: Just before the morning assembly, during the school day start</li></ul><p>The tragedy unfolded during school hours, making it one of the most severe school infrastructure-related disasters in recent years in Rajasthan.</p><h2>Why Did the Roof Collapse?</h2><p>The exact reason is under investigation, but preliminary assessments suggest:</p><ul><li>Structural weakness due to water seepage during monsoon</li><li>Aging infrastructure not flagged during prior inspections</li><li>Ignored warnings by students about falling dust and gravel</li></ul><p>According to engineers from the <strong>Public Works Department (PWD)</strong>, signs of internal damage were visible, but the building was <strong>not listed among “unsafe” structures</strong> in recent audits.</p><h2>How Was the Response Handled?</h2><p>The <strong>initial rescue was led by villagers, parents, and school staff</strong>, who used motorcycles, cars, and even their hands to pull children from the debris. Due to the delay in ambulances reaching the remote location, many of the injured were transported using <strong>private vehicles and tractors</strong>.</p><p>Later, <strong>fire brigades, police, RTO officers</strong>, and emergency teams arrived and secured the area. The local administration coordinated <strong>hospital transfers</strong>, and forensic teams began surveying the damage to ascertain the root cause.</p><h2>Administrative & Political Repercussions</h2><p>Following public outrage:</p><ul><li>The school’s <strong>Principal Meena Garg and four staff members</strong> were <strong>suspended</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>Rajasthan Education Minister, Madan Dilawar</strong>, offered <strong>₹10 lakh compensation</strong> to each bereaved family and <strong>promised contractual jobs</strong> to one member of the affected families.</li><li>The <strong>Chief Minister ordered a statewide audit</strong> of all school buildings to assess safety standards.</li><li>Opposition parties including the <strong>Congress</strong> termed the incident <strong>“criminal negligence”</strong>, demanding resignations and a judicial probe.</li></ul><p>Former Chief Minister <strong>Vasundhara Raje</strong> also criticized the government, calling the event an example of the system’s failure to protect the most vulnerable.</p><h2>What Happens Next?</h2><p>The government has ordered an immediate <strong>infrastructure safety audit</strong> of all government school buildings, hospitals, and public structures in Rajasthan. Structures found unsafe will be vacated immediately, and students relocated to alternate facilities.</p><p>The deceased children will be memorialized with <strong>classrooms named after them</strong> in newly constructed buildings.</p><h2>Summary Table</h2><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered table-striped"><thead><tr><th>Detail</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>What</td><td>School roof collapse in Rajasthan</td></tr><tr><td>Where</td><td>Piplodi Govt Upper Primary School, Jhalawar district, Rajasthan</td></tr><tr><td>When</td><td>July 25, 2025, around 7:40 AM</td></tr><tr><td>Who</td><td>7 students dead, 21+ injured (grades 6–8)</td></tr><tr><td>Why</td><td>Suspected structural failure due to rain damage and ignored safety signs</td></tr><tr><td>How</td><td>Roof collapsed during class;
