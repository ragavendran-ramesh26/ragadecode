                        <span style="font-size: 14px;
    color: grey;">Published on: 28 Jun 2025 </span>
                        

                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p><strong>Kolkata, India</strong></p>
<p>A 24-year-old first-year law student was allegedly gang-raped inside the <strong>South Calcutta Law College</strong> premises on the night of <strong>June 25</strong>, triggering widespread outrage and political tensions in West Bengal. The incident has once again spotlighted rising concerns over campus safety and women’s security.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Happened?</h2>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kolkata-law-college-gang-rape-case-three-arrested-including-staff-member-2747081-2025-06-27">India Today</a>, the survivor was allegedly lured to the union room of the college by a former senior who had previously proposed marriage. Once there, she was overpowered and assaulted by three individuals.</p>
<p>The accused have been identified as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monojit Mishra</strong> (31) – Former student and alleged Trinamool Congress student wing (TMCP) functionary.</li>
<li><strong>Zeb Ahmed</strong> (19) – Current student.</li>
<li><strong>Prome Prit Mukhopadhyay</strong> (20) – Current student.</li>
</ul>
<p>All three were arrested within 12 hours of the complaint being filed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Police Action and Investigation</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/kolkata-law-student-gang-raped-in-college-guardroom-two-seniors-ex-student-held-11751012149153.html">LiveMint</a>, the police acted promptly following the survivor&#39;s complaint. The three accused were arrested, their mobile phones seized, and the union room was sealed for forensic examination.</p>
<p>A <strong>medical examination</strong> confirmed <strong>forceful penetration, bite marks, and scratch injuries</strong>, supporting the survivor’s testimony. She also recorded her statement before a magistrate, clearly identifying all three attackers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Political Fallout</h2>
<p>The incident quickly turned political. The <strong>BJP</strong> accused the ruling <strong>Trinamool Congress (TMC)</strong> of shielding the accused, citing Monojit’s alleged TMCP links. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/kolkata-rape-case-political-slugfest-erupts-in-bengal/articleshow/122119094.cms">Economic Times</a> reported that BJP leaders even called for Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s resignation.</p>
<p>Responding to the criticism, <strong>TMC Minister Shashi Panja</strong> stated that the police acted with urgency and impartiality. She affirmed that the victim’s complaint was taken seriously and the law would take its full course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The girl has named the accused, and police arrested all three within 12 hours,” she told <a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/west-bengal/kolkata-forceful-penetration-bite-marks-medical-examination-validates-gang-rape-allegation-by-kolkata-law-student-at-kasba-college-2025-06-27-996582">India TV News</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Deeper Concerns</h2>
<p>The crime has drawn comparisons to the <strong>2024 R.G. Kar Medical College rape and murder</strong> case, which had also rocked the city and led to massive protests. The <strong>National Commission for Women (NCW)</strong> has taken cognizance of the current case and has sought a full report from the state government.</p>
<p>The incident raises renewed questions about <strong>campus safety</strong>, <strong>political accountability</strong>, and <strong>justice for survivors</strong> of sexual violence.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While the swift arrests reflect urgency, the political overtones and emotional weight of this case have sparked a broader conversation about how institutions handle such incidents. Public attention remains fixed on whether justice will be delivered without bias.</p>
