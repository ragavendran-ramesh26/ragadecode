                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p>In a major policy reversal that underscores the power of regional identity and civic protest, the Maharashtra government has <strong>officially withdrawn its decision to make Hindi the default third language</strong> in primary schools. The contentious move, rooted in the implementation of the <strong>National Education Policy (NEP)</strong>, faced severe backlash from political parties, cultural figures, and the general public.</p>
<h2>Decision Reversed Ahead of Monsoon Session</h2>
<p>Chief Minister <strong>Devendra Fadnavis</strong>, speaking before the <strong>monsoon session</strong> of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, announced the withdrawal of two key Government Resolutions (GRs) dated <strong>April 16</strong> and <strong>June 17</strong>, which aimed to introduce <strong>Hindi as a mandatory third language</strong> in Classes 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Instead, the state has decided to adopt a <strong>wait-and-watch approach</strong>. Fadnavis announced the formation of a <strong>new expert committee</strong> headed by <strong>Dr. Narendra Jadhav</strong>, a noted economist, educationist, and former Rajya Sabha MP. This committee will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommend <strong>the grade level</strong> at which new languages should be introduced.</li>
<li>Evaluate <strong>implementation frameworks</strong> suitable for Maharashtra’s diverse linguistic landscape.</li>
<li>Suggest <strong>student choice models</strong> that balance national policy with local identity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Rising Political Heat and Public Outcry</h2>
<p>The policy U-turn came in response to <strong>sustained protests</strong> from opposition parties, especially the <strong>Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)</strong> and <strong>Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)</strong>. These parties accused the <strong>central government</strong> and its allies in the state of attempting to <strong>impose Hindi</strong> under the guise of NEP compliance, thereby undermining Maharashtra’s <strong>regional languages</strong> and <strong>cultural autonomy</strong>.</p>
<p>Public anger was further fueled when <strong>eminent Marathi authors and poets</strong> returned awards in protest, citing language imposition as a threat to cultural integrity. Social media campaigns and grassroots mobilizations brought the issue into public discourse, forcing the government to rethink its stance.</p>
<h2>Language, Identity, and Education: A Delicate Balance</h2>
<p>The <strong>three-language policy</strong> under NEP is designed to promote <strong>multilingualism</strong> in India’s diverse education system. However, its <strong>uniform application across states</strong> has sparked debates. Critics argue that mandating Hindi as a third language in non-Hindi-speaking regions like Maharashtra violates the <strong>spirit of federalism and linguistic diversity</strong>.</p>
<p>Educators and psychologists also raised concerns about the <strong>cognitive load on young students</strong>, warning that too many compulsory languages at the primary level can hinder learning outcomes and alienate students from their mother tongue.</p>
<h2>Committee&#39;s Mandate and Next Steps</h2>
<p>The <strong>Jadhav Committee</strong> is expected to engage with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linguistic experts</strong></li>
<li><strong>Educators and teachers&#39; associations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Parent groups</strong></li>
<li><strong>Political stakeholders</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Its report will determine whether Hindi — or any language — can be introduced at the foundational level without compromising local linguistic traditions. Until the report is complete and reviewed, <strong>no new language implementation</strong> will proceed in schools.</p>
<h2>Broader Implications</h2>
<p>Maharashtra’s reversal marks a <strong>significant moment in India’s language politics</strong>. It sends a strong message about the importance of <strong>consultative policymaking</strong>, especially in culturally sensitive areas like education. It also reflects growing resistance to <strong>centralized mandates</strong> that may not align with <strong>regional aspirations</strong>.</p>
<p>As states continue to grapple with NEP’s ambitious goals, the Maharashtra case could set a <strong>precedent</strong> for other non-Hindi states reconsidering how best to uphold <strong>India’s multilingual fabric</strong> without eroding <strong>regional identities</strong>.</p>
