                            <h2>🇮🇳 Operation Sindhu: India&#39;s Evacuation Mission from Iran</h2>
<p>In response to escalating hostilities between <strong>Iran and Israel</strong>, the Government of India initiated <strong>Operation Sindhu</strong> to safely evacuate its nationals from high-risk zones. The first phase of the mission successfully transported <strong>110 Indian students</strong> from northern Iran to Armenia by road, followed by their airlift to New Delhi.</p>
<p>The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) is actively coordinating further evacuations, advising Indian citizens in Iran to maintain contact with the embassy in Tehran and the 24/7 control room in New Delhi. The evacuation underscores India’s swift diplomatic response in volatile regions.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🤝 India-Croatia Bilateral Engagements: Strategic Agreements Signed</h2>
<p>Prime Minister <strong>Narendra Modi</strong> held formal discussions with Croatian Prime Minister <strong>Andrej Plenković</strong> during his official visit to <strong>Zagreb</strong>, resulting in the signing of four strategic agreements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agriculture and Allied Sector Cooperation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Science &amp; Technology Collaboration</strong> (2025–2029)</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Exchange Program</strong> (2026–2030)</li>
<li>Establishment of a <strong>Hindi Chair at the University of Zagreb</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both leaders emphasized expanding cooperation in fields such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pharmaceuticals  </li>
<li>Clean and Digital Technology  </li>
<li>Renewable Energy  </li>
<li>Shipbuilding and Cybersecurity  </li>
<li>Academic Research and Joint Innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>Modi reiterated the importance of <strong>territorial integrity</strong> and advocated for <strong>dialogue and diplomacy</strong> as the path forward in resolving international conflicts.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌍 Croatia’s Backing for India-Europe Economic Integration</h2>
<p>Croatian Prime Minister Plenković endorsed India&#39;s role in the proposed <strong>India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor</strong>, identifying Croatia as a Mediterranean gateway to Central Europe. He expressed support for the <strong>India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA)</strong> and acknowledged India&#39;s leadership in fostering South-South cooperation.</p>
<p>The Croatian side also extended solidarity with India over the <strong>Pahalgam terror attack</strong>, supporting India’s firm stance against terrorism.</p>
<p>During the visit, Prime Minister Modi also met with Croatian President <strong>Zoran Milanović</strong>, where both parties reaffirmed shared democratic values and committed to expanding trade, technology partnerships, and cultural ties.</p>
<hr>
<h2>📞 Modi–Trump Call: Security, Conflict Zones, and Strategic Cooperation</h2>
<p>In a 35-minute phone call initiated by <strong>former US President Donald Trump</strong>, discussions focused on global security developments including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Iran-Israel conflict</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Russia–Ukraine war</strong></li>
<li>Regional stability in <strong>West Asia</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Prime Minister Modi conveyed India’s position that terrorism must be recognized as <strong>direct warfare</strong> and stressed the necessity of decisive responses. The call also included a renewed invitation to Trump to attend the upcoming <strong>Quad summit in India</strong>, which he accepted.</p>
<p>Trump remarked that Iran had recently expressed interest in negotiations but termed the move “too late,” hinting at strategic indecision from the American side regarding military action.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🛑 Iran’s Response to US Pressure</h2>
<p>Iran’s Supreme Leader <strong>Ali Khamenei</strong> rejected calls for unconditional surrender, warning that any US military intervention would result in <strong>irreparable damage</strong>. The statement reflects heightened tensions in the region and a growing risk of broader conflict.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🌐 Developments in Europe and Russia</h2>
<p>In <strong>Portugal</strong>, a minority center-right government officially took office after defeating a motion of opposition by the Communist Party. The administration plans middle-class tax cuts, a defense spending increase, and constructive dialogue with rival parties.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Russia inaugurated the <strong>28th St. Petersburg International Economic Forum</strong>, attracting over <strong>20,000 participants from 140 nations</strong>. Discussions at the forum are expected to center on climate action, digital governance, and rethinking global economic cooperation. Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> is scheduled to deliver the keynote address.</p>
<hr>
<h2>🔍 Conclusion</h2>
<p>India’s multi-pronged diplomatic efforts—from rescue operations in West Asia to reinforcing strategic ties in Europe—highlight its assertive presence on the global stage. The visit to Croatia, coupled with Operation Sindhu and high-level engagement with the United States, reflects a calibrated foreign policy shaped by assertiveness, preparedness, and a focus on regional and global stability.</p>
