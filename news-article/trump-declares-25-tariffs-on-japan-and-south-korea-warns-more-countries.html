He plans to place a 25% import tax (tariff) on goods from Japan and South Korea starting August 1st. This is part of his effort to fix what he calls “unfair” trade deals. Trump believes the U.S. is not getting equal treatment and wants better deals for American workers.</p><h2>August 1: New Tariffs Begin</h2><p>The new tariffs will begin on August 1. Trump said that by July 9, most countries will either get a signed letter or finalize a trade deal with the U.S. These letters explain why the tariffs are needed and what the U.S. expects from each country. Japan and South Korea are the first two nations to receive these notices.</p><h2>Why These Tariffs?</h2><p>Trump says trade with Japan and South Korea has not been fair. In his view, these countries sell a lot to the U.S. but don’t buy enough American products in return. By adding a 25% tax on imports, he hopes to push these countries to trade more fairly.</p><h2>No Room for Retaliation</h2><p>Trump warned Japan and South Korea not to fight back by raising their own tariffs. If they do, the U.S. will respond by raising tariffs even higher. This could hurt big industries like Japanese car companies and South Korean tech firms. Trump is using these tariffs as pressure to protect American jobs and businesses.</p><h2>More Countries Next in Line</h2><p>This is not just about Japan and South Korea. Trump said that up to 15 more countries will receive similar letters in the coming days. Some may get new tariffs, while others might reach quick trade deals. These actions show a larger strategy to reset global trade rules in favor of the U.S.</p><h2>What Else Did Trump Say?</h2><p>During the press event, Trump also spoke about other issues. He said FEMA is still busy helping after recent floods in Texas, and he plans to visit the area soon. He also talked about possible peace deals in the Middle East and updates on Ukraine and Iran.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Trump’s announcement marks a major change in U.S. trade policy. With tariffs starting August 1 and new letters going out, many countries now face a choice—make a fair deal with the U.S. or pay higher taxes on their exports. Trump’s focus remains clear: protect American jobs and demand fair trade from every partner.</p><div class="location-block">United States</div></div></div><div class="card mt-4 shadow-sm"><div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-center align-items-md-start p-3 gap-3"><div class="flex-shrink-0 text-center"><img src="https://ragadecode-media.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/media/ragavendran-ramesh-1.png" alt="Ragavendran Ramesh" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" width="64" height="64" loading="lazy"></div><div class="text-center text-md-start"><h5 class="card-title mb-1">Decoded by <strong>Raga</strong></h5><a href="/authors/ragavendran-ramesh" class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm">About Ragavendran Ramesh</a></div></div></div><a href="/" class="btn btn-outline-primary mt-4 d-inline-flex align-items-center"><i class="fas fa-arrow-left me-2"></i> Back to Home</a><div class="text-center mt-4 mb-4"><div id="affiliate-3-rectangle"></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-xl-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0"><section class="faq-section"><section class="faq-section"><h3 class="text-center mb-4">Quick Info</h3><div class="faq-item mb-4"><div class="faq-question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i> What new tariff did Donald Trump announce?</div><div class="faq-answer mt-2">Donald Trump announced a 25% import tariff on goods from Japan and South Korea, set to begin on August 1.
