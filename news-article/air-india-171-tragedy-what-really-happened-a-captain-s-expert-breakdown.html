                        <img class="cover-image" src="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/hq720_bb82a9e5a5.jpg" alt="Air India 171 Tragedy: What Really Happened? A Captain’s Expert Breakdown" loading="lazy" />

                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p>In the wake of the <strong>Air India 171 crash</strong>, aviation communities and the public worldwide are searching for answers. In a special episode of <em>Ask the Captain</em>, veteran pilot <strong>Captain Steve</strong> addresses the key technical questions raised about the crash. From the cause of thrust loss to RAT deployment and flap configurations, here’s a <strong>complete decoded breakdown</strong> of the expert insights.</p>
<hr>
<h3>🎙️ How Did the Sole Survivor Make It?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The survivor was seated just <strong>in front of the wing spar</strong>, one of the strongest points in the aircraft.</li>
<li>The <strong>wing spar absorbed much of the impact</strong>, possibly sparing the force where the survivor sat.</li>
<li>Captain Steve calls it <strong>“nothing short of a miracle.”</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>✈️ Landing Gear: Why Was It Down?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Video shows the gear remained down, but evidence suggests the pilots <strong>did raise the gear handle</strong>.</li>
<li>However, due to power loss, the <strong>hydraulic/electrical system failed to fully retract it</strong>.</li>
<li>The gear wheels were <strong>angled backward</strong>, a sign the system may have partially attempted retraction.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>⚙️ What Is the RAT (Ram Air Turbine) and Why Does It Matter?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The RAT is an emergency device that <strong>deploys during complete engine or electrical failure</strong>.</li>
<li>It provides <strong>minimal hydraulic and electrical power</strong>, enabling limited control and communication.</li>
<li>RAT deployment in this case <strong>strongly suggests dual engine failure</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>💥 Loud Bang After Takeoff: What Was It?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>sole survivor</strong> reported a loud bang 30 seconds after takeoff.</li>
<li>Likely causes:<ul>
<li><strong>RAT deployment noise</strong> as it slams into the airstream.</li>
<li><strong>Structural damage</strong> or part of the aircraft hitting an object.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lights also reportedly <strong>flickered</strong>, reinforcing the RAT theory.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>🛬 Flap Configuration: Were the Wings Clean?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Early speculation of <strong>premature flap retraction</strong> has been dismissed.</li>
<li>Wreckage photos show:<ul>
<li><strong>Leading-edge slats deployed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Flaps set at ~5°</strong>, confirming proper takeoff configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Flaps were <strong>not the cause</strong> of lift loss—<strong>thrust loss was</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>🌡️ High Temperatures and Vapor Lock?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reported temperatures: <strong>37°C to 43°C</strong>.</li>
<li>High heat can disrupt <strong>engine airflow</strong> or cause <strong>fuel vaporization (vapor lock)</strong>.</li>
<li>Vapor lock may lead to:<ul>
<li><strong>Fuel turning into gas</strong></li>
<li><strong>Loss of engine thrust</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It’s <strong>rare</strong>, but not impossible under extreme heat and pressure.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>📡 The Mayday Call: What Did It Reveal?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pilots radioed “<strong>no thrust achieved</strong>” shortly after takeoff.</li>
<li>That suggests <strong>both engines lost power</strong> during climb-out.</li>
<li>Combined with RAT deployment and loss of lift, this aligns with a <strong>catastrophic dual engine failure</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>🛫 Takeoff Performance: Did They Use the Whole Runway?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Witnesses reported <strong>dust clouds</strong> as the aircraft lifted off.</li>
<li>Captain Steve explains this is likely due to:<ul>
<li><strong>Thrust vector angle</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dry conditions</strong>, not necessarily overrun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engines were <strong>producing thrust</strong> at that moment—but failed soon after.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>🧑‍✈️ First Officer’s Experience: Was It Enough?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reported to have <strong>1,100 flight hours</strong>.</li>
<li>Below the <strong>1,500-hour U.S. minimum</strong>, but may be <strong>standard under different regulations</strong>.</li>
<li>Captain Steve praises the <strong>professionalism</strong> and <strong>training</strong> of the crew.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>⚠️ RAT Deployment: What Does It Confirm?</h3>
<ul>
<li>On the 787, RAT is deployed for:<ul>
<li>Dual engine failure</li>
<li>Major electrical or hydraulic failure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this case, the <strong>only failure that causes lift loss is engine failure</strong>.</li>
<li>Therefore, RAT + wing stall = <strong>confirmed engine flameout</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>💡 Was It a Stall?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The aircraft <strong>mushed into the ground</strong> after lift was lost.</li>
<li>Classic signs of stall seen:<ul>
<li><strong>Nose drop</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tail sag</strong></li>
<li><strong>Loss of airspeed</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Thrust loss led to <strong>loss of energy in the wings</strong>, inducing stall.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>🧪 Fuel Contamination or Vapor Lock?</h3>
<p>Three possible causes for fuel starvation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fuel control levers off</strong> — not plausible.</li>
<li><strong>Contaminated fuel</strong> (water, particles) — extremely rare, but possible.</li>
<li><strong>Vapor lock</strong> — high temperature may have <strong>turned fuel to vapor</strong>, starving engines.</li>
</ol>
<p>All are speculative, but <strong>not ruled out</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>🧾 Did the Pilots Have Time to Save the Aircraft?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The entire sequence—from <strong>rotation to crash</strong>—lasted under <strong>60 seconds</strong>.</li>
<li>Dual engine restart procedures require <strong>more altitude and time</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Not enough time</strong> for checklists or recovery.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>👨‍✈️ Final Words on the Crew</h3>
<p>Captain Steve’s closing thoughts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These were some of the best-trained pilots in the world.<br>To send a mayday in English under pressure — that shows presence of mind.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>📌 Conclusion: A 100-Billion-to-One Event</h3>
<p>This tragedy was an <strong>extraordinarily rare event</strong>. While investigations continue, early signs point to a <strong>dual engine flameout</strong>, likely due to mechanical or environmental causes. As the aviation community continues to analyze and learn, <strong>lessons will be implemented to ensure this never happens again</strong>.</p>
