    color: grey;">Published on: 3 Jul 2025 </span>
                        <img class="cover-image" src="https://genuine-compassion-eb21be0109.media.strapiapp.com/Screenshot_2025_07_03_at_11_59_06_AM_c8e232d05e.png" alt="Prof. Deivam Latest Interview to Reporters – About Nikita’s Scam & Ajith Kumar Custodial-Death Case" loading="lazy" />

                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p>On <strong>2 July 2025</strong> outside the Madurai Press Club, retired lecturer <strong>Prof. R. Deivam</strong> faced reporters and retold a decade-old nightmare: his former student <strong>Nikita</strong> (often spelled <em>Nikitha</em>), together with her mother <strong>Sivagami</strong> and brother <strong>Kavi</strong>, took nine lakh rupees from him by promising two “sure-shot” government jobs.<br>That same Nikita is now the complainant whose theft report led to the police detention and eventual death of 27-year-old temple guard <strong>Ajith Kumar</strong>. Deivam’s story adds crucial context to why the theft case itself is under intense scrutiny.</p>
<hr>
<h2>1. What Prof. Deivam Says</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The promise:</strong> Nikita phoned him in 2012, claiming high-level political contacts and offering two permanent posts if he paid <strong>₹ 9 lakh</strong> immediately.  </li>
<li><strong>The trust factor:</strong> She had been his B.Ed student in 2010-11, so her family seemed reliable.  </li>
<li><strong>The loss:</strong> He borrowed heavily, handed over the money, received glossy appointment letters—and never heard from the trio again.  </li>
<li><strong>Wider impact:</strong> Deivam later discovered families in Thirumangalam, Karur, Coimbatore and beyond who lost similar sums to the same promise.  </li>
<li><strong>Long haul:</strong> Despite police complaints filed as early as 2011, the accused repeatedly evaded arrest or conviction, leaving victims like him drowning in debt and court dates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“They ruined my retirement with that nine-lakh lie, and they ruined Ajith Kumar’s family too.”</em> — Prof. R. Deivam</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>2. Ajith Kumar’s Death in Police Custody</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The theft complaint:</strong> On <strong>27 June 2025</strong> Nikita and her mother reported that ten sovereigns of gold jewellery vanished from their car at a temple near Sivaganga.  </li>
<li><strong>Custody and death:</strong> Local police picked up temple guard Ajith Kumar for questioning. He was allegedly beaten during a second round of interrogation and declared dead on 28 June.  </li>
<li><strong>Fallout:</strong> Five officers were arrested and the case was <strong>transferred to CB-CID</strong> – see in-depth coverage <a href="https://ragadecode.com/news-article/sivaganga-custodial-death-five-policemen-arrested-case-transferred-to-cb-cid">here</a>.  </li>
<li><strong>Key question:</strong> If Nikita’s past fraud is proven, was her jewellery complaint genuine—or the latest deception that indirectly cost a man his life?<br>A detailed timeline of the lock-up events can be found <a href="https://ragadecode.com/news-article/shocking-lock-up-death-in-tamil-nadu-ajith-kumar-allegedly-killed-in-police-custody">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>3. Why Nikita’s Past Matters Now</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pattern of deceit</strong> – Deivam’s testimony confirms a decade-long cash-for-job racket run by the same family.  </li>
<li><strong>Credibility of the theft FIR</strong> – With a documented history of fraud, Nikita’s new claim of stolen jewellery faces scepticism in court and in the public eye.  </li>
<li><strong>Missed warnings</strong> – Had earlier cheating cases reached trial and conviction, the chain of events leading to Ajith Kumar’s death might never have begun.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>4. Ongoing Investigations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ajith Kumar custodial-death case:</strong> Now under CBI supervision (handed over from CB-CID); five policemen remain in judicial custody.  </li>
<li><strong>Revival of the 2011 job-fraud FIR:</strong> Economic Offences Wing has reopened the docket; victims, led by Prof. Deivam, are filing a consolidated petition for speedy trial.  </li>
<li><strong>Authenticity of Nikita’s theft complaint:</strong> A High-Court-monitored inquiry is examining whether the jewellery-loss report was fabricated.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>5. Prof. Deivam’s Public Appeal</h2>
<p><em>“Never pay anyone upfront for a government post. If they truly have authority, the offer will come as an official order—not a cash demand,”</em> he warns.<br>By speaking out, he hopes investigators and the judiciary will see a continuous pattern linking <strong>white-collar fraud</strong> and a <strong>custodial tragedy</strong>, both centred on the same family.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Prof. Deivam’s fresh interview does more than revisit an old scam; it underscores how unresolved economic crimes can ripple into far darker outcomes. His testimony may shape both the custody-death investigation and the revival of long-ignored cheating cases—potentially delivering long-overdue justice to victims on both fronts.</p>
