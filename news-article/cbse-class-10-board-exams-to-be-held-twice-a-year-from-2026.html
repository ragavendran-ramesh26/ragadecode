                        <div class="content-body">
                            <p><strong>New Delhi | June 25, 2025</strong></p>
<p>In a landmark shift aligned with India&#39;s National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has officially announced that <strong>Class 10 board exams will be conducted twice a year starting from 2026</strong>. This move is aimed at reducing academic stress, offering students flexibility, and giving them another opportunity to improve their scores.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Are the New Rules?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Two Board Exams Every Year</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>February</strong>: <em>Mandatory</em> for all Class 10 students.</li>
<li><strong>May</strong>: <em>Optional</em> – for those who want to improve scores or couldn&#39;t clear up to 3 subjects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Best Score Counts</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The better score out of the two attempts in each subject will be considered for the final result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Internal Assessments</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will still be conducted <strong>only once</strong> per academic year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Eligibility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only students who attempt the February exam in all compulsory subjects will be eligible to appear in the May attempt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Why This Move?</h2>
<p>This reform has been made in line with the NEP’s push to make education more flexible and less exam-centric. By giving students a second chance in the same academic year, the government hopes to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce high-stakes pressure</li>
<li>Prevent year-long delays for improvements</li>
<li>Allow fairer evaluation across different learning speeds</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Official Statements</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first phase will be conducted in February and the second in May… appearing in the first phase is mandatory while the second is optional.”<br>— <em>Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE Exam Controller</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is a step towards a stress-free learning environment.”<br>— <em>Dharmendra Pradhan, Union Education Minister</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>The new two-phase exam model offers a lifeline for students to improve scores within the same academic year, creating a more student-centric and flexible educational approach. It encourages a healthier learning environment by reducing the anxiety of a single high-stakes exam and allows room for self-paced preparation. The reform also enhances opportunities for better performance evaluation by educators and supports a shift toward a more progressive academic system in line with NEP goals.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Criticisms and Concerns</h2>
<p>While the reform is being praised, educationists and teachers have raised some concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased workload</strong> on teachers for extended academic sessions.</li>
<li>Risk of <strong>commercialization</strong> through the coaching industry.</li>
<li>Possible <strong>parental pressure</strong> on students to attempt both exams, even when unnecessary.</li>
<li>Logistical and financial pressure for reappearing students.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>What Lies Ahead?</h2>
<p>Although this policy currently applies only to <strong>Class 10</strong>, the CBSE has indicated that <strong>Class 12</strong> may also adopt a similar system in the future. Stakeholders are watching closely for how well this will be implemented across the country’s diverse educational landscape.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The new CBSE Class 10 board exam format from 2026 is a bold step toward flexibility, mental well-being, and academic fairness. The real success, however, will depend on transparent guidelines, adequate teacher support, and responsible implementation by schools and parents alike.</p>
