He was raised in a culturally rich and educated Telugu family. His father, Seetha Rama Anjaneyulu, was a well-respected doctor in the local community. From a young age, Kota exhibited a flair for the performing arts, especially drama and public speaking, which would later shape his illustrious acting career.</p><p>Kota hailed from India, a country known for its deep artistic roots and diversity. He was born and spent his early years in Andhra Pradesh, a southeastern Indian state renowned for its contributions to Telugu literature, cinema, and classical music. Specifically, Kankipadu, located in the Krishna district, was his hometown—a region steeped in agrarian traditions and known for its cultural values.</p><h2>Education and Early Career</h2><p>Kota pursued his early education in local schools in Krishna district before enrolling at Andhra Christian College, Guntur, for his Bachelor of Science degree. Initially, he had no formal intention of joining the film industry; instead, he aimed for a conventional career. He worked briefly in the State Bank of India and was preparing for civil services. However, his passion for drama and stage performances during his college days began to take precedence.</p><h2>Parents and Their Influence</h2><p>His father, Dr. Seetha Rama Anjaneyulu, being a medical practitioner, desired a stable and reputable career for his son. Although initially hesitant about Kota's interest in acting, he later became supportive. His mother, whose name is not publicly recorded, was a homemaker and an ardent supporter of his artistic pursuits. His upbringing in an educated household with strong ethical values greatly influenced Kota's disciplined approach to both his personal life and professional career.</p><h2>Family Life: Wife, Son, and Daughters</h2><p>Kota Srinivasa Rao married Rukmini Rao, and the couple had three children: a son, Venkata Anjaneya Prasad, and two daughters whose names remain private. Tragedy struck when his only son, Venkata Anjaneya Prasad, a promising young man working in a private firm, died in a road accident. This loss deeply affected Kota, and though he continued to work, he spoke about this emotional scar in multiple interviews. His wife, Rukmini Rao, remained his pillar of strength throughout his journey.</p><h2>Career: Films and Politics</h2><h3>Stage to Screen</h3><p>Kota's foray into acting began with theatre. His performances in college plays earned him recognition and ultimately led him to the film industry. He debuted in the film <em>Pranam Khareedu</em>, which also starred Chiranjeevi. Over the years, he established himself as one of the most versatile character actors in Indian cinema.</p><h3>Film Career</h3><p>Kota appeared in more than hundreds of films across Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi languages. Known for his deep voice, commanding presence, and masterful portrayal of both comedic and villainous roles, he left a lasting mark with performances in:</p><ul><li><em>Pratighatana</em></li><li><em>Gaayam</em></li><li><em>Aha Naa Pellanta</em></li><li><em>Money</em></li><li><em>Bommarillu</em></li><li><em>Athadu</em></li><li><em>Rakta Charitra</em></li></ul><h3>Political Career</h3><p>Kota joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in the 1990s and was elected as a Member of Legislative Assembly from Vijayawada East. During his tenure, he actively advocated for cultural policies and the welfare of artists.</p><h2>Awards and Recognitions</h2><p>Kota Srinivasa Rao was one of the most awarded actors in Telugu cinema. His notable accolades include:</p><ul><li>Padma Shri – India’s fourth-highest civilian award for contributions to the arts</li><li>Nandi Awards by Andhra Pradesh Government</li><li>SIIMA Award for Best Supporting Actor</li></ul><h2>Awards by Film and Social Activities</h2><ul><li><em>Pratighatana</em> – Nandi Award for Best Villain</li><li><em>Gaayam</em> – Nandi Award for Best Supporting Actor</li><li><em>Aa Naluguru</em> – Nandi Award for Best Character Actor</li><li><em>Krishnam Vande Jagadgurum</em> – SIIMA Award for Best Supporting Actor</li></ul><p>Kota was also involved in social causes including rural education and healthcare awareness. He regularly contributed to charitable trusts and was a patron for several art and drama schools.</p><h2>Film Count by Language</h2><ul><li><strong>Telugu</strong>: Majority of his career</li><li><strong>Tamil</strong>: Significant contributions</li><li><strong>Kannada</strong>: Several roles</li><li><strong>Hindi</strong>: Some appearances</li><li><strong>Malayalam</strong>: A few notable roles</li></ul><p>This distribution underscores his prominence in South Indian cinema, especially the Telugu industry.</p><h2>Final Film Appearance</h2><p>Kota Srinivasa Rao’s final on-screen appearance was in the historical film <em>Hari Hara Veera Mallu</em> starring Pawan Kalyan, slated for release posthumously. Though aged and ailing, he gave a powerful performance—poignantly marking the end of his cinematic journey.</p><h2>Cause of Death</h2><p>Kota Srinivasa Rao passed away on July 13, at his residence in Hyderabad. The cause of death was reported as multi-organ failure following prolonged age-related illness. He had been undergoing treatment for the past few months and breathed his last at his residence in Filmnagar.</p><p>His funeral will be held with full state honors, and tributes are expected to pour in from film stars, politicians, and fans across India, marking the end of an era in Indian cinema.</p><div class="location-block">India | Telangana | Hyderabad</div></div></div><div class="card mt-4 shadow-sm"><div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row align-items-center align-items-md-start p-3 gap-3"><div class="flex-shrink-0 text-center"><img src="https://ragadecode-media.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/media/ragavendran-ramesh-1.png" alt="Ragavendran Ramesh" class="img-fluid rounded-circle" width="64" height="64" loading="lazy"></div><div class="text-center text-md-start"><h5 class="card-title mb-1">Decoded by <strong>Raga</strong></h5><a href="/authors/ragavendran-ramesh" class="btn btn-outline-secondary btn-sm">About Ragavendran Ramesh</a></div></div></div><a href="/" class="btn btn-outline-primary mt-4 d-inline-flex align-items-center"><i class="fas fa-arrow-left me-2"></i> Back to Home</a><div class="text-center mt-4 mb-4"><div id="affiliate-3-rectangle"></div></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-xl-4 mt-4 mt-lg-0"><section class="faq-section"><section class="faq-section"><h3 class="text-center mb-4">Quick Info</h3><div class="faq-item mb-4"><div class="faq-question"><i class="fas fa-question-circle text-primary me-2"></i> Who was Kota Srinivasa Rao?</div><div class="faq-answer mt-2">Kota Srinivasa Rao was a celebrated Indian actor and politician known for his extensive work in Telugu cinema, as well as appearances in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi films.
