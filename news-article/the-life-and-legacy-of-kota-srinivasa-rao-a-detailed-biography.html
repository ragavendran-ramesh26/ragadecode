            <p>Kota Srinivasa Rao was born on July 10 in Kankipadu, a small town in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh, India. He was raised in a culturally rich and educated Telugu family. His father, Seetha Rama Anjaneyulu, was a well-respected doctor in the local community. From a young age, Kota exhibited a flair for the performing arts, especially drama and public speaking, which would later shape his illustrious acting career.</p>
<p>Kota hailed from India, a country known for its deep artistic roots and diversity. He was born and spent his early years in Andhra Pradesh, a southeastern Indian state renowned for its contributions to Telugu literature, cinema, and classical music. Specifically, Kankipadu, located in the Krishna district, was his hometown—a region steeped in agrarian traditions and known for its cultural values.</p>
<h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
<p>Kota pursued his early education in local schools in Krishna district before enrolling at Andhra Christian College, Guntur, for his Bachelor of Science degree. Initially, he had no formal intention of joining the film industry; instead, he aimed for a conventional career. He worked briefly in the State Bank of India and was preparing for civil services. However, his passion for drama and stage performances during his college days began to take precedence.</p>
<h2>Parents and Their Influence</h2>
<p>His father, Dr. Seetha Rama Anjaneyulu, being a medical practitioner, desired a stable and reputable career for his son. Although initially hesitant about Kota&#39;s interest in acting, he later became supportive. His mother, whose name is not publicly recorded, was a homemaker and an ardent supporter of his artistic pursuits. His upbringing in an educated household with strong ethical values greatly influenced Kota&#39;s disciplined approach to both his personal life and professional career.</p>
<h2>Family Life: Wife, Son, and Daughters</h2>
<p>Kota Srinivasa Rao married Rukmini Rao, and the couple had three children: a son, Venkata Anjaneya Prasad, and two daughters whose names remain private. Tragedy struck when his only son, Venkata Anjaneya Prasad, a promising young man working in a private firm, died in a road accident. This loss deeply affected Kota, and though he continued to work, he spoke about this emotional scar in multiple interviews. His wife, Rukmini Rao, remained his pillar of strength throughout his journey.</p>
<h2>Career: Films and Politics</h2>
<h3>Stage to Screen</h3>
<p>Kota&#39;s foray into acting began with theatre. His performances in college plays earned him recognition and ultimately led him to the film industry. He debuted in the film <em>Pranam Khareedu</em>, which also starred Chiranjeevi. Over the years, he established himself as one of the most versatile character actors in Indian cinema.</p>
<h3>Film Career</h3>

<li><em>Rakta Charitra</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Political Career</h3>
